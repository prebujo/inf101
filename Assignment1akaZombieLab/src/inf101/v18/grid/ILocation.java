/**
 * Represents a location within an {@link IArea}.
 * <p>
 * <em>Immutable:</em> Locations are immutable; i.e., a particular
 * <code>ILocation</code> will always have the same x- and y-coordinates and
 * cannot be changed. Methods that find neighbours (such as
 * {@link #go(GridDirection)}) will return another <code>ILocation</code>.
 * <p>
 * <em>Area:</em> All {@link ILocation}s are tied to an {@link IArea}, thus they
 * will know whether they are on the edge of the area (and not all neighbouring
 * grid coordinates will be valid locations within the area) and other
 * coordinate system properties that are determined by the {@link IArea} (e.g.,
 * if the coordinate system wraps around like on the surface of a donut).
 * <p>
 * <em>Unique objects:</em> All {@link ILocation} in an {@link IArea} are
 * unique. This means that <code>area.location(x,y) == area.location(x,y)</code>
 * for all <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, and that:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // equality is reference equality for locations in the same area
 * if (l1.getArea() == l2.getArea())
 * 	assertEquals(l1.equals(l2), (l1 == l2));
 * </pre>
